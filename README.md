## Project Story

Nova-Cart is a full-stack e-commerce platform I built to understand real-world order flows, variant-based cart logic, and role-based dashboards. I focused heavily on data integrity, clean architecture, and realistic admin workflows rather than demo features.

## Features Under Consideration

The following features are planned for future iterations of the project to enhance traceability, reliability, and administrative control. These are intentionally deferred and architecturally anticipated.

### 1. Order Audit Log (Admin / Super Admin)

- Track all order-related actions and state changes
- Log order status transitions (e.g., Pending → Shipped → Delivered)
- Record admin/system/user actions with timestamps
- Immutable, append-only audit history
- Useful for debugging, compliance, and dispute resolution

### 2. Product Audit Log

- Track price changes
- Track stock updates
- Log product visibility/status changes
- Record admin attribution for each action

### 3. User Activity Log

- Login and logout history
- Password reset events
- Role or plan changes
- Basis for future security monitoring

### 4. Order Versioning

- Snapshot order data at key lifecycle stages
- Prevent historical data drift when product or variant data changes
- Ensure invoice and refund consistency

### 5. Advanced Invoice System

- Multiple invoice versions per order
- Support for refunds and credit notes
- Invoice download history tracking

### 6. Global Admin Action Log

- Centralized log for all admin CRUD operations
- Covers products, categories, vendors, plans, and settings
- Improves accountability and traceability

### 7. Event-Based Notification System

- Notifications triggered by audit log events
- Admin alerts for critical system changes
- User notifications for order lifecycle updates

### 8. Soft Delete and Restore System

- Soft delete support for orders, products, and users
- Restore functionality with audit tracking
- Prevents accidental permanent data loss

### 9. Reporting and Analytics Layer

- Order lifecycle analytics
- Admin activity insights
- Revenue and order-change correlation reports
